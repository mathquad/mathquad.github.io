<h3>Math Question Understanding and Answering Dataset </h3>
This database contains curated sets of K-12 math curriculum based "psets" 
for training neural nets and bots for automated explanation of strategies for
solving math problems. The problems in the PSETS contain detailed
step by step strategies for solving a given problem. The PSETS
will also be correlated to a detailed concept map that captures the
relationships among topics in the
entire K-12 math curriculum. 
<br><br>
The primary aim of the PSETS is to serve as a train set for a new family of deep neural nets
focused on <i> inductive reasoning </i>. The step by step solution and associated
meta-data of problem solving strategies are aimed at enhancing the
<i> inductive reasoning</i> capabilities of a neural net.
The aim of the training is not on providing the right answer, 
but also on explaning how to solve the given problem. Can the automated 
system learn to generalize the explaination for each step involved 
in the solution to a given math problem? 
<br><br>
In addition to curriculum oriented problems, the PSETS contain problems
from following math competitions and olympiad. These problems and
step by step strategies for their solution are included to help train
an automated bot to compete at the highest levels of math competitions.

</ul>
<br>
We will also utilize problems from past olympiad competitions (from all over the world).
<br>
Out ultimate goal is to build an automated bot that can one day compete in and win the International Math
Olymiad (IMO)! While winning the IMO be a nice icing on the cake, our real aim is to build several
bots that help kids learn, enjoy, and appreciate the beauty of math!
