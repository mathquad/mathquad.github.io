<h3>Math Question Understanding and Answering Dataset </h3>
<br>
This dataset contains K-12 curriculum based "psets" for training
neural nets and bots for automated explanation of strategies for
solving math problems. The problems in the PSETS contain detailed
step by step strategies for solving the given problem.
<br>
The focus is not on providing the right answer, but on explaning
how to solve the given problem.
<br>
The use of the curriculm map enables the automated system to detect and
monitor the progress of a learner and the system can adjust and adapt its
dialog and explanation to cater to the needs of the learner.
