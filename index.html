<h3>Math Question Understanding and Answering Dataset </h3>
<br> Recently a group of <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04146"
                            target = "_blank"> researchers at Deep Mind (Google) </a>
have demonstrated the feasibility of an automated system's ability
to solve and explain algebraic word problems. Inspired by this
work, we are working on a curated sets of mathematical problem
for the training of deep neural nets.
<br> <br>
This dataset contains curated sets of K-12 curriculum based "psets" 
for training neural nets and bots for automated explanation of strategies for
solving math problems. The problems in the PSETS contain detailed
step by step strategies for solving the given problem.
<br>
The primary focus of the PSETS is to train a neural net. The aim of the
training is not on providing the right answer, but also on explaning
how to solve the given problem. Can the automated system explain each
step involved in the solution to the problem?
<br>
The use of the curriculm map enables the automated system to detect and
monitor the progress of a learner and the system can adjust and adapt its
dialog and explanation to cater to the needs of the learner.
<br>
In addition to curriculum oriented problems, the PSETS contain problems
from following math competitions and olympiad. These problems and
step by step strategies for their solution are included to help train
an automated bot to compete at the highest levels of math competitions.

</ul>
<br>
We will also utilize problems from past olympiad competitions (from all over the world).
<br>
Out ultimate goal is to build an automated bot can one day win the IMO! Along the way, we hope to build several
bots that help kids learn math!
