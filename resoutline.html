This reseach involves:
<ul>
<li> Explanation of solutions to a given math problem by generating a sequence of solution micro-steps, 
  (execution of all such micro-steps would yield the correct solution).</li>
<li> Determination of math problem micro-steps for the entire K-12 curriculum.</li>
<li> Comprehending information provided in text and images (understanding of problems that encode 
part of the information in companion images).</li>
<li> Explanation of the solution in an interactive dialog format, taking into cosideration 
the prior knowledge (in the curriculum) of the learner.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The research effort will address the following challenges:
<ul>
<li> A master and hieractical map of math concepts and associated problem solving micro-steps. </li>
<li> Understand information encoded in both text and images (of math problems). </li>
<li> An authoring enviroment where experts can write detailed and step-by-step solutions to math problems - 
utilizing the math-micro-steps and adding additional meta data that can help train the neural net.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The research will utilize recent results from the following efforts:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04146" target="_blank">Learning to Solve and Explain Algebraic Problems </a> 
    from Google/DeepMind.  <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/AQuA" target="_blank"> The dataset (100K problems). </a> </li>

    Segmenting Images with Masks from Facebook</a> Example of masks for different shapes are shown below. 
  Parsing numerical informatione encoded in images accompanying mathematical problems is an area of focus for this 
    project. The shapes in images accompanying math problems may not overlap, but will contain additional numerical
  information and mathematical notations! </li>
