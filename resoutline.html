This reseach involves:
<ul>
<li> Explanation of solutions to a given math problem by generating a sequence of solution micro-steps, 
  (execution of all such micro-steps would yield the correct solution).</li>
<li> Determination of math problem micro-steps for the entire K-12 curriculum.</li>
<li> Comprehending information provided in text and images (understanding of problems that encode 
part of the information in companion images).</li>
<li> Explanation of the solution in an interactive dialog format, taking into cosideration 
the prior knowledge (in the curriculum) of the learner.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The research effort will address the following challenges:
<ul>
<li> A master and hieractical map of math concepts and associated problem solving micro-steps. </li>
<li> Understand information encoded in both text and images (of math problems). </li>
<li> An authoring enviroment where experts can write detailed and step-by-step solutions to math problems - 
utilizing the math-micro-steps and adding additional meta data that can help train the neural net.</li>
</ul>
